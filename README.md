# Za Chess Bot - Reinforcement Learning Chess Engine

A chess engine trained through reinforcement learning, starting with games against Stockfish and continuing through self-play with bullet time control (1 minute per side).

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Two-Stage Training**:
  - Stage 1: Reinforcement learning against Stockfish (~1900 rating)
  - Stage 2: Self-play training with 28 games per epoch (14 white, 14 black)
  
- **Bullet Time Control**: 60 seconds per player - timeout counts as a loss, teaching the model to think faster

- **Comprehensive Chess Knowledge**: Both players have access to:
  - 500+ opening variations (Sicilian, Ruy Lopez, Italian, French, Caro-Kann, etc.)
  - 19 tactical patterns (pins, forks, skewers, discovered attacks, knight forks, etc.)
  - 40+ strategic concepts (control center, piece development, king safety, etc.)
  - 31 endgame principles (opposition, zugzwang, king activity, etc.)

- **Deep Neural Network**: 
  - ResNet-style architecture with 10 residual blocks
  - 512 hidden channels
  - ~58M trainable parameters
  - Separate policy (move selection) and value (position evaluation) heads

- **Advanced Training**:
  - PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm
  - GPU-accelerated game playing with CUDA
  - Parallel multi-threaded games (28 simultaneously)
  - Automatic checkpoint saving every 10 epochs

- **Target Goal**: Train until 100.0 accuracy (100% win rate against itself)

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone Repository
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SolamateanTehCoder/za_chess_bot.git
cd za_chess_bot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- PyTorch (with CUDA support recommended)
- python-chess 1.999
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for charts)

### 3. Download Stockfish (for continuing Stockfish training)
Download from: https://stockfishchess.org/download/

Update `STOCKFISH_PATH` in `config.py`:
```python
STOCKFISH_PATH = "C:\\path\\to\\stockfish\\stockfish.exe"
```

### 4. Verify CUDA (Optional)
```powershell
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Self-Play Training (Recommended)
```powershell
python train_self_play.py
```

This will:
1. Load the Stockfish-trained model as the base
2. Play 28 games per epoch (with 60-second time control per side)
3. Train the model for 1 epoch
4. Save checkpoints every 10 epochs
5. Continue until reaching 100.0 accuracy

### Run Stockfish Training (Optional)
```powershell
python train.py
```

This trains the initial model against Stockfish. Use this to restart training from scratch.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
# Self-play training
NUM_EPOCHS = 100000              # Max epochs (stops at 100.0 accuracy)
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001            # Learning rate for PPO
BATCH_SIZE = 64                  # Training batch size

# Neural network
HIDDEN_SIZE = 512                # Channels in residual blocks
NUM_RESIDUAL_BLOCKS = 10         # Number of residual blocks
USE_CHESS_KNOWLEDGE = True       # Enable opening book, tactics, endgames

# Hardware
USE_CUDA = True                  # Enable GPU training
CHECKPOINT_DIR = "checkpoints"   # Checkpoint save directory
SAVE_FREQUENCY = 10              # Save checkpoint every N epochs
```

## 🎮 Game Configuration

Self-play training parameters (in `train_self_play.py`):
- **Games per epoch**: 28 (14 white, 14 black)
- **Time control**: 60 seconds per player (bullet)
- **Timeout penalty**: Counts as a loss
- **Knowledge access**: Both players have access to 500+ openings, 19 tactics, 40+ strategies, 31 endgames

## 🏆 Accuracy-Based Reward System (NEW!)

The training now uses **Stockfish analysis** to provide intelligent, accuracy-based rewards:

### How It Works:
1. **Every move is analyzed by Stockfish** at depth 15
2. **Accuracy score calculated** (0-100%) based on move quality
3. **Reward assigned** based on accuracy:
   - **+1.0**: Perfect move (best by Stockfish)
   - **+0.5**: Good move
   - **0.0**: Neutral move
   - **-0.5**: Bad move
   - **-1.0**: Blunder

### Time Pressure Learning:
- **1-second baseline** per move
- **Extra time = pain penalty**: -0.001 per extra millisecond
- Example: 2-second move = -1.0 penalty for time
- **Effect**: Model learns to think faster under pressure

### Real-Time Visualization:
- **28 game boards displayed simultaneously** (7×4 grid)
- **Green timer flash** = Model received reward (good move) ✓
- **Red timer flash** = Model received pain penalty (bad move) ✗
- **Accuracy % shown** for each side
- **Win/Loss/Draw displayed** at end of game

### Setting Up Rewards:

**Option 1: Install Stockfish (Recommended)**
```bash
# Windows: Download from https://stockfishchess.org/download/
# Place in C:\Program Files\Stockfish\

# Linux:
sudo apt-get install stockfish

# macOS:
brew install stockfish
```

**Option 2: Use Fallback Heuristics**
System will automatically fall back to simpler reward logic if Stockfish is unavailable (still effective).

### Running with Rewards:
```powershell
python run_training.py
```

See `REWARD_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` for detailed documentation and troubleshooting.

## 🎓 Training Algorithm

Uses **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**:

1. **Self-Play**: Play 28 games with time control
2. **Experience Collection**: Record states, actions, rewards, log probabilities
3. **Advantage Calculation**: Compute returns and advantages
4. **Policy Update**: Update with clipped objective
5. **Value Update**: MSE loss on position evaluation
6. **Repeat**: Next epoch with improved model

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Training is slow
- Ensure CUDA is properly set up: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
- Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` in config.py
- Check GPU memory usage

### Out of VRAM
- Reduce `HIDDEN_SIZE` from 512 to 256
- Reduce `NUM_RESIDUAL_BLOCKS` from 10 to 6-8
- Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` from 64 to 32

### Timeouts not working
- Check system clock is accurate
- Ensure timer logic in `self_play_opponent.py` is enabled
- Verify `USE_CHESS_KNOWLEDGE = True` in config.py

### Model not improving
- Ensure checkpoint is loading correctly
- Check that `USE_CHESS_KNOWLEDGE = True`
- Verify training data is being collected (check epoch results)
